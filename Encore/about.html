                  <p>I am very enthusiastic about future in the dental space and what we are doing &ndash; for dentists, for patients, for dental staff &ndash; up and down the service chain.</p>
                  <p>I built a successful cardiology practice, one of the largest in the nation at the time, in Gulfport, Mississippi, and began investing in real estate through our company Encore Enterprises in the 1990's. Encore Enterprises is now a successful, fully diversified commercial real estate and investment firm with over $1 Billion in assets under management.</p>
                  <p>At Encore we are operators &ndash; hands on. We have built and infrastructure platform that runs efficiently and can pivot quickly as needed for the economy and for our affiliate companies. We succeed at what we do because we are disciplined, fair, completely transparent in our business dealings, and because we have built an overall culture that I am proud of and that is sustainable as we move forward.</p>
                  <p>As a physician first, I understand the priority of the oath for patient care. I have seen throughout my career that if you treat the patient right, the business will come. That is why we empower the dentist and dental staff so that patient care can be their choice.</p>
                  <p>These are truly exciting times. As a dentist, we hope you will visit with us about your opportunities to work with and partner with us. We look forward to seeing you!</p><br/>
